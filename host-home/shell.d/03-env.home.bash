# Add your system-specific ENV settings here
#
# Since Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite), if you want your environment variables to be
# seen by applications not launched from within a terminal/shell, you should
# set them via a launch agent and launchctl.
#
# For example, a launch agent configuration that sets JAVA_HOME for the current
# user at login can be placed in a file named `local.setenv.JAVA_HOME.plist`
# (exact filename is arbitrary, except ending) which is placed in
# $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/ and has the following content:
#
# <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
# <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
# <plist version="1.0">
# <dict>
#     <key>Label</key>
#     <string>local.setenvironment</string>
#     <key>Program</key>
#     <string>/bin/launchctl</string>
#     <key>ProgramArguments</key>
#     <array>
#          <string>launchctl</string>
#          <string>setenv</string>
#          <string>JAVA_HOME</string>
#          <string>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_20.jdk/Contents/Home</string>
#     </array>
#     <key>RunAtLoad</key>
